Text Editing 201
****************

Vim
===
Vim is an insertion mode editor just like VI.
The differences between Vi and Vim aren’t terribly significant. Vim is simply an improved version of Vi. It pretty much has a ton of functionality that Vi doesn’t.

Within Vim you can see the differences between Vi and Vim by running the following command: 

`:h vi-differences`

Emacs
=====
Emacs is an extensible system for editing text built on top of a powerful programming language. With a typical text editor you can only do what the author thought to include commands for. Emacs can be made to do pretty much anything you can think of. Unlike VI and VIM, Emacs is not an insertion mode editor, meaning that any character typed in Emacs is automatically inserted into the file, unless it includes a command prefix.

Both VIM and Emacs support many fundamental virtues of text editors such as extensive syntax highlighting, collapsible functions, spell checking, macros, undo-redo, multiple document editing, and a large support community. They are both free, Open Source, mature and well developed pieces of software. But...while both Emacs and Vim are considered powerful text editors, both capable of providing many of the same feature lists for general editing commands, the primary difference between these editors is the fundamental philosophy behind their design, and more to the point, the types of workflow that they were originally designed to handle.
